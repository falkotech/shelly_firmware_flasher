ota_firmware_flasher script works without internet connection. So you have to download the firmware you need and save it in a folder. 

You can download Shelly firmware versions from http://archive.shelly-tools.de/
Eg. you can download v1.11.8 for a Shelly plug S from http://archive.shelly-tools.de/version/v1.11.8/SHPLG-S.zip
